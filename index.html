                <p class-="profile__summary">Hello! My name is Zachary Martin, and I'm a software developer, with a passion for solving complex problems and building clean, efficient, working code. I'm currently enrolled in a top-rated software development bootcamp and will earn a certificate of software development upon completion in August 2022. Through hard work and dedication, I have gained a solid understanding of Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Spring, Thymeleaf, Source Control (Git and GitHub), and front-end development using HTML and CSS. Through my career as a developer, I hope to use my skills and knowledge base around Java and its frameworks and libraries, and front-end knowledge, to help improve the user experience. I am looking forward to a career in tech, and I believe I have a lot to contribute to any development team. Feel free to click any of the photos below to view the associated project in GitHub. If you're a recruiter or hiring manager, or if you would just like to connect, you can contact me at zm102905@gmail.com. Links to my Github and LinkIn profiles are also provided below.</p>

                    This is the first application that I wrote in coding bootcamp. It's a simple, Java-based text-based application, where the user takes the role of an animal caretaker for a virtual dog. The player can interact with the virtual dog in a number of ways, which change the variable values of the pet object. A while loop was used in the main method, which iterates with every action and breaks out of the loop when the losing-conditions are met. A tick method was written and implimented into the loop, which simulates the passage of time. Writing this required a solid understanding of object and method creation, and class design.

                    Virtual Pet Shelter is basically a continuation of the Virtual Pet project. In this Java-based app, the user takes the role of both volunteer and visitor. Similar to Virtual pet, this app allows for pet interaction. What makes this different, is there are multiple pet objects that the user can interact with individually, or as a group. Each action changes the variable values of the pet objects differently. A while loop was used, which iterates after every action the user takes and breaks when the losing conditions are met. A hashmap was utilized to store all of the pet objects with their associated keys and values. Methods were introduced, which allow the user to either add or remove pets. This application required a more in-depth understanding of object and method creation, logic, as well as class design.

                    Virtual Pets Amok is a Java-based application, that builds on the Virtual Pet Shelter project. The main difference is this app utilizes the four pillars of object-oriented programming, which are abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. A heirarchy was made, dividing the main virtual pet class into robotic and non-robotic pets. These two child-classes of virtual pet were divided into two grandchild classes, cat and dog. Each child and grandchild class has unique instance variables, and instance variables inherited from their parent classes. Beyond that, it's very similar to the other two projects. The pet data is stored in a hashmap. Methods were introduced that apply specific actions to each subclass, or the shelter as a whole. An interface was used to impliment a walk method to only the dog classes (robotic and organic). This project required an understanding of the four pillars of object oriented programming/class design, in addition to method and object creation.
